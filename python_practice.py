# This is your first coding assignment for Computational BME.
# As discussed in class, feel free to use AI tools to help you complete this assignment, but remember to cite them.
# I encourage you to try the problems yourself first and only use AI tools when you are stuck to benefit your learning.

# Problem 1: Practice writing pseudocode

# Write pseudocode that will input a integer N and output the sum of the first N numbers in the fibonacci sequence.
# Fibonacci sequence starts: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
# Example: If N = 5, the output should be 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7

""" # you can use three double-quotes to write multi-line comments
INPUT integer N 
SET first_fib = 0
SET second_fib = 1 
SET count = 0 
SET total = 0 

WHILE count < N: 
    ADD first_fib to total 
    SET next_fib = first_fib + second_fib 
    SET first_fib = second_fib 
    SET second_fib = next_fib
    INCREMENT count by 1

OUTPUT total

# Problem 2: Comment your code
# Comments are very helpful for others (especially when pair-coding!) and yourself to understand your code! Add comments to the following code, which will run but produces the wrong output. Once you comment the code, you should be able to identify the error and fix it (the correct total that should be printed is 12).
N = 6

a = 0 # set a to the first fibonacci number
b = 1 # set b to the second fibonacci number
count = 0
total = 0 #running sun 

while count < N:
    total = total + a

    next_value = a + b
    a = b
    b = next_value

    count = count + 1 #increment counter 

print(total)

# Problem 3: Using common Python libraries
# What is the standard deviation of the first 10 numbers in the fibonacci sequence? Use the numpy library to calculate the standard deviation.
import numpy as np 
fib = [0,1]
for i in range(8):    fib.append(fib[-1]+fib[-2])

std_dev = np.std(fib)

# %% ###########################################################
# Problem 4: Don't repeat yourself by writing functions
# Write a function that takes an integer N as input and returns the sum of the first N numbers in the fibonacci sequence.
# Then use this function to calculate the sums for N = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 and print them as a list.
def sum_fibonacci (N):
    a, b = 0, 1 
    total = 0 
    count = 0

        a, b = b, a+b

# Problem 5: Read your error messages
# Run the following code block to see what the error messages are. Then, for each error:
# 1. Identify what type of error it is (SyntaxError, NameError, TypeError, etc.)
# 2. Add a comment to the line that is throwing the error explaining what the error is
# 3. Fix the error so that the code runs correctly

# You will only see one error at a time when you run the code. After fixing one error, run the code again to see the next error. Your final code should work correctly and will have comments where the original errors were.

# Problem 6: Test your code
# The following function will run but will output the wrong answer sometimes. Add test cases to verify that the function works correctly for a variety of inputs. If you find any inputs that produce incorrect outputs, fix the function. The function, when working properly, should return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to the input "limit".
